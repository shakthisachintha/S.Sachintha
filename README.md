About Game
    This is almost a basic snake game.It has 600X600 Pixel Canvas as the playground.
    1 Point will be given for every foods that snake eats and also the snake will get longer.
    After Collecting 5 points level will be jumped by one and also the speed of the snake and the framerate will also get increased.
    Collide with the walls(borders of the canvas) or coliding with the snake itself will end the game.


Description
    I have used a javascript framework called p5js as a WEBGL it is quite simple to use and have many built in functions to detect key press events and lot more..and have used html5 as the markup language.
